# ProDevWork
(9/26/2018)
Today is the first day of writing this. We had to pick a ProDev buddy using the free market strategy.
I need to make sure that I put some focus into networking while I am in the bootcamp or I risk having
a harder time getting a job after the bootcamp. 

* Quantative accomplishments:
    - I have exercised 8 of the last 10 days 
    - During that time I have lost 2.5 pounds in that time.
    - I have lived in a dirrent country entirely on my own for 9 months.

* Qualitative Features:
    - I have a good work etic, but that can lead to sometimes overworking myself.
    - I have very good attention to detail, especially when it comes to coding, but this mean that I sometimes
      get lost in the minute details rather than looking at grand scope of what I am working on and can lose
      focus on it.
    - Similarly with the second point, I am very much a perfectionist when it comes to coding. This can lead
      to me being frustrated and overwokring on one part of project for too long and losing time for the
      overall project.

* Passion Project
    - I of my biggest hobbies is playing videogames. For someone like me, videogames can somtimes be a release, 
      but they can also be a way to challenge both my logical brain and my creative brain. For example,
      I play a lot of puzzles games. This is very straightforward in how that helps my logical brain, but it 
      also helps my creative brain as well. Sometimes, even puzzles have creative and unique ways that they can 
      be solved, which helps the creative side of my brain. Another thing I like to do with videogames is 
      actually try to break them. Not physically obviously, but push the software in such a way that it breaks.
      Games rarely break in the way that you would think and it is very helpful to my creative brain just think
      of ways to do this. Once I do break it, I can use my logical brain to determine why it broke.

* Elevator pitch
    - Hello, my name is Matthew. I am trying to get a software development job at this company that expand my
      skillset. I am currently doing a Java and Android bootcamp to help refine the skill I already have. Do you
      have any job opportunities?

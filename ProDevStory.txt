Today is the first day of writing this. We had to pick a ProDev buddy using the free market strategy.
I need to make sure that I put some focus into networking while I am in the bootcamp or I risk having
a harder time getting a job after the bootcamp. 

* Quantative accomplishments:
    - I have exercised 8 of the last 10 days 
    - During that time I have lost 2.5 pounds in that time.
    - I have lived in a dirrent country entirely on my own for 9 months./

* Qualitative Features:
    - I have a good work etic, but that can lead to sometimes overworking myself.
    - I have very good attention to detail, especially when it comes to coding, but this mean that I sometimes
      get lost in the minute details rather than looking at grand scope of what I am working on and can lose
      focus on it.
    - Similarly with the second point, I am very much a perfectionist when it comes to coding. This can lead
      to me being frustrated and overwokring on one part of project for too long and losing time for the
      overall project.
